Create a Database and manage it.
•	SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
Extract, Transform and Load (ETL process) the data from (CSV) file into tables in the database.
•	Power BI
Use Power BI desktop to create reports and publish them into Power BI service.
Use Power BI service to create an app.
Use data gateway in Power BI service to make sure the dataset is up-to-date.

# DataFlow 

Dataset (csv) => Create the database (Sql Server) => ETL (SSIS) => Create Report pages (PowerBI Descktop)
